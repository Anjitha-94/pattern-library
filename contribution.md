# Dgl 104 Add react native for singleton pattern

I have read about react native code for solving the issue assigned to me. From that readings I found that react native is a framework in javascript.

This implementation of the React Native Singleton pattern provides a structured way to manage shared state among several application components. It uses a static property to ensure that only one instance of the class is created and to grant global access to its methods and attributes.



### Key Components

* Static Instance Variable (_instance): A private static variable that holds the single instance of the class. This ensures that there is only one instance of the Singleton class throughout the application.

* Constructor: Checks if an instance already exists by examining _instance. If it exists, the constructor returns the existing instance instead of creating a new one. If it doesn't exist, the constructor initializes the class's state and assigns the newly created instance to _instance.

* Static Getter (instance): A static getter method that provides global access to the Singleton instance. It creates the instance if it doesn't exist and returns the existing instance if it does.

* State Management (getState and setState): Methods to get the current state and update the state of the Singleton, respectively. setState merges the new state with the existing state, allowing for updates.

* Object.freeze(): Called on the Singleton class to prevent any future modifications, ensuring the integrity and immutability of the Singleton instance.



## Usage within a React Native Component


The SingletonDemo component demonstrates how to interact with the Singleton class to manage shared state within a React Native application.

Key Components of SingletonDemo:


* Constructor: Accesses the Singleton instance using Singleton.instance and stores it in the component's state. This provides a way to interact with the shared state managed by the Singleton.

* updateSingletonState Method: A method defined to update the state of the Singleton. It demonstrates how to modify shared state across the application through the Singleton instance.

* renderSingletonState Method: This method retrieves the current state from the Singleton and renders it. It illustrates how to access shared state from the Singleton and display it within a component.

* Render Method: Defines the UI of the component, displaying the current state stored in the Singleton and providing a button to trigger a state update. This showcases the Singleton's role in facilitating shared state management across different parts of the application.
